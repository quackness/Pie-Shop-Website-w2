    <h1>Welcome to Bethany's Pie Shop!</h1>
    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p>
      For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her
      home. In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy
      little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell
      in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies...
      The store became a success in no time.<br /><br />In 2015, no less than
      100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger
      building. After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next
      step was making it possible to order pies from the comfort of your own
      home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of
      this: our very own webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's
      delicious pies whenever you feel like it!

      Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredientrs. This way, she can
      make sure that our pies are absolutely the best.
